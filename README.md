# MazeEscape
Maze escape is a game where the aim is to escape out of a randomly generated maze before your opponents. At the start of each game, you get a viewing stage where you get to look at the maze for a short period of time before you are placed into the centre of it.
There are enemies lurking in the maze which will try to kill you as you escape so make sure to shoot them first otherwise you risk spawning back at the centre.
